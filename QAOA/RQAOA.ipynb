    "Recursive QAOA (RQAOA) is an iterative variant of QAOA, first introduced by Bravyi et al. in [1] and further explored in [2,3]. \n",

The expectation values are then ranked according to their magnitude $|\\mathcal{M}_{(i),(ij)}|$, where we use $\\mathcal{M}_{(i),(ij)}$ to generically refer to both single- and two-spin expectation values. In its original formulation, the highest ranked value is selected. This value is then utilized to eliminate a qubit from the Hamiltonian, by imposing a constraint on the respective qubits, according to the nature of the highest ranked expectation value. The two kinds of constraints are\n",

Inserting the correponding constraint directly into the Hamiltonian, we reduce the size of the problem by one qubit. Using the reduced Hamiltonian, QAOA is then run again and the same procedure is followed. Once the reduced problem reaches a predefined cutoff size $n_{\\textrm{cutoff}}$, it is solved exactly via classical methods. The final answer is then reconstructed by re-inserting the eliminated qubits into the classical solution following the appropriate order.\n",

    "In summary, the process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute QAOA\n",
    "2. Compute expectation values $\\mathcal{M}_{(i),(ij)}$ of terms present in the Hamiltonian\n",
    "3. Rank expectation values according to their magnitude $|\\mathcal{M}_{(i),(ij)}|$\n",
    "4. Select the expectation value with highest magnitude\n",
    "5. Eliminate variable by imposing the appropriate constraint and obtain reduced problem\n",
    "6. If new problem size is smaller than $n_{\\textrm{cutoff}}$, obtain final solution classically and reinsert constraints, else, return to step 1 using the reducedproblem\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of RQAOA is included in OpenQAOA. Additionally, OpenQAOA incorporates RQAOA from two different generalized version of these procedure, which enable multiple qubit eliminations during the recursive process, modifying steps 4 and 5 above. These strategies are denoted as `custom` and `adaptive` [4], in accordance with the precise concept under which the elimination method takes place. In a nutshell, they are described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``custom`` strategy allows the user to define the number of eliminations to be performed at each step. This is defined by the parameter ``steps``. If the parameter is set as an integer, the algorithm will use this value as the number of qubits to be eliminated at each step. Alternatively, it is possible to pass a list, which specifies the number of qubits to be eliminated at each step. For ``steps = 1``, the algorithm reduces to the original form of RQAOA presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ``adaptive`` strategy adaptively selects how many qubits to eliminate at each step. The maximum number of allowed eliminations is given by the parameter ``n_max``. At each step, the algorithm selects the top ``n_max+1`` expectation values (ranked in magnitude), computes the mean among them, and uses the ones lying above it for qubit elimination. This corresponds to a maximum of ``n_max`` possible elimination per step. For ``n_max= 1``, the algorithm reduces to the original form of RQAOA presented in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The specific performance of these generalizations is currently under investigation. In particular, the development of Adaptive RQAOA is associated with an internal research project at Entropica Labs to be released publicly in the near future [4]. We make these strategies already available to the community in order to strengthen the exploration of more complex elimination schemes for RQAOA, beyond its original formulation [1]."

    "In these plots we can appreciate an important aspect of RQAOA: the topology of the problem will evolve unpredicatably throughout the recursive process. In this case, where we only consider quadratic terms, the only constraint that will be imposed is that of fixing one qubit with respect to a second one. In the language of graphs, this can be understood as merging two nodes, where the remaining node inherits all the edges from the merged one. From the point of view of the Hamiltonian, the couplings associated with qubits that were connected to both of the merged qubits will add up. For example, if we merge qubit $i$ into qubit $j$, and both where connected to qubit $k$ through couplings $J_{ik}$ and $J_{jk}$, the resulting connection between the remaining qubit $j$ and qubit $k$ will be $J_{jk} \\mapsto J_{jk} + J_{ik}$. You can easily check this by yourself by defining some generic Hamiltonian and imposing the constraint defined in the introduction! As a result, some edges will acquire values beyond the initial definition $|J_{ij}| = 1$. Furthermore, sometimes the couplings will cancel each other, resulting in certain edges disappearing from the graph. This can be observed on the second step of the process above, where the connection between qubits 1 and 2 has disappeared. Through the same mechanism, new connections can emerge between previously disconnected qubits, e.g. in the third step all qubits are again connected with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we had also included linear terms in the problem and the constraints associated will single-spin expectation values were to be imposed, the change of topology would correspond to removing a node from the graph along with all edges incident in it. "
